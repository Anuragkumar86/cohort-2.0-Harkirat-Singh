# 🚀 Cohort 2.0 – Full Stack, DevOps & System Design Journey

**Instructor:** Harkirat Singh (Live Cohort)

This repository documents my complete **0 → 100 engineering journey** through the **Cohort 2.0** program, covering:

- Full-Stack Development (MERN)
- Backend Engineering
- Frontend Engineering
- DevOps & CI/CD
- System Design

The repository is intentionally maintained as a **single monorepo**, organized **week-wise**, reflecting how real-world engineering teams structure large codebases and long-term learning tracks.

---

## 🧭 What This Repository Represents

- End-to-end progression from fundamentals to advanced engineering concepts  
- Hands-on implementations instead of theoretical notes  
- Industry-aligned tooling, workflows, and best practices  
- Backend, frontend, DevOps, CI/CD, and system design in one place  
- A **learning archive** combined with an **engineering showcase**

## 🏗️ Organization Philosophy

- Each **Week** folder corresponds to the topics covered in that week  
- A week may contain multiple sub-projects, experiments, or demos  
- CI/CD pipelines are centralized under `.github/workflows`  
- Complexity and architectural depth increase progressively
